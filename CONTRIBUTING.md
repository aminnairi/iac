**How Can I Contribute?**

- You like this project? Share it around you network!

This may be the easiest contribution you can give and it helps me get more people to test things out and report bugs or maybe new features I did not see at the time being.

- Seen something buggy? Report it by filling an issue!

Do not be shy and search for your issue first: someone may have already opened up a similar one and you can also discuss about it in the issue thread. No similar issue? Not a problem! Just open a new one and wait for people (or me) to confirm the issue (it may also be a feature and you did not know about it).

- You want to dive in the code and append some changes (you did relate to an issue first, right? RIGHT?!)

Well, be my guest! For now, I have little to none documentation on how to setup things for development but this is something that is comming as soon as people will be willing to help on this project.
